# Bark Avenue Grooming

![Amiresponsive image](media/amiresponsive.png)

I decided to create a booking site for Bark Avenue Grooming because I wanted to challenge myself and step out of my comfort zone. The walkthroughs we had in the course were a blog post and a simple to-do list, so I didn't want to completely replicate them. I did take elements from both, though; the blog post walkthrough was particularly helpful for setting up this project. However, I aimed for this site to be mostly my own. Interestingly, my mom actually runs a grooming business by the same name, so I leaned on her for help with some of the smaller details. In this README, I'll delve into the full process of creating this site and discuss possible features I may want to add in the future.

### Color Scheme

![website color scheme](media/color.png)

For my previous web pages I had something to take the color from that had to do with the theme.
This time there's no history involved I tried to keep it simple Black and White with a splash of Color.
And I chose the light blue as the splash because it's my mom's favourite color and she inspired this site.

### Wireframes

For my wireframes i used to use balsamiq but my free trail actually ran out, so this time around I'm using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/),
It's not what I'm used to but it still gave me the help I needed to visually plan out most of this project.

## Features

### General

### Navbar

![Navbar](media/navbar.png)
![Navbar](media/navbar2.png)

- I used a simple navbar for this project just basic white background with simple text and the companys logo.

- I mostly just wanted the navbar to be responsive at all screen sizes.

- So I used Bootstrap to make this navbar, at smaller screens it turns the links into a hamburger icon for ease of use and a cleaner design.

### Call to action

![Call to action ](media/calltoaction.png)

- Again the design for this is pretty simple, it has a clear function. It tells the user the name of the company and gives them a button to where they can go straight to the booking form.

- I added the background image to make the home page seem a bit more fun and add some life to it.

### Footer

![Footer](media/footer.png)

- The footer of this site just contains the social media links, when the user hovers over said icon it changes color to a color associated with that site.
